See [npm issue 1486](https://npmjs.com/advisories/1486)

Denial of Service vulnerability in @vue/cli-service > webpack-dev-server > http-proxy-middleware > http-proxy

"All versions of http-proxy are vulnerable to Denial of Service. An HTTP request with a long body triggers an ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT unhandled exception that crashes the proxy server. This is only possible when the proxy server sets headers in the proxy request using the proxyReq.setHeader function."
